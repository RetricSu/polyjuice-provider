# Polyjuice Provider

godwoken-polyjuice compatible providers for ethereum library like [ethers](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js) and [web3js](https://github.com/ChainSafe/web3.js). now you can call your smart-contract on godwoken-polyjuice with metamask and eth address.

***- Note: since [Godwoken](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken) had some changed for instant-finality, please upgrade your Polyjuice-Provider over [0.0.1-rc14](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/polyjuice-provider/releases/tag/v0.0.1-rc10) version or above. otherwise you might not be able to fetch tx-receipt as fast as possible. (2021.11.15)***

***- Note: since [Godwoken-web3](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken-web3) will have some APIs deprecated in the future, it is recommend to upgrade your Polyjuice-Provider over [0.0.1-rc10](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/polyjuice-provider/releases/tag/v0.0.1-rc10) version or above. as early as possible. (2021.09.15)***

## Install

```sh
yarn add @polyjuice-provider/web3
yarn add @polyjuice-provider/ethers
yarn add @polyjuice-provider/truffle
```


## Usage

- [APIs](docs/api.md)

`note: this project is still under development, some APIs might be changed in the future.`

## Need another provider?

right now we have 3 compatible providers:

- Web3 compatible provider: `/packages/web3`
- ethers compatible provider: `/packages/ethers`
- truffle compatible HdWalletProvider: `/packages/truffle`

if you need another compatible provider, you can request via opening an issue or even create an pull request by yourself :) we hope community can takes part in and build more useful tools together for godwoken-polyjuice.

## How It Works?

there are three main differences between Godwoken-Polyjuice and Ethereum:

1. Different Transaction Structure: when you send an ethereum transaction to Godwoken-Polyjuice, the data structure of this very transaction needs to be converting to godwoken transaction type.
2. Different Signing Message: when you are signing a Godwoken-Polyjuice tx, it will looks like you are requesting to signing a message using ethereum personal-sign method.
3. Different Address Type: when you pass some address-type parameters to call smart-contract, the address converting must be done in order to feed the right data for Godwoken-Polyjuice. vice versa for the return address value.

provider are designed to got these 3 things done for you and your dapp, mainly by:

1. convert Ethereum transaction to Godwoken L2 transaction.
2. generate signing message from Godwoken L2 transaction and call Metamask for signing (or use privateKey in non-browser env).
3. do address type converting according to your contract's Abi. that's why you need to pass AbiItems to provider constructor. you can pass [multiple smart-contracts ABIs to provider](docs/get-started.md#L91) if needed.

## Known Caveats Of polyjuice-provider

- currently we do not support not-created-yet contract-address passing as address type parameter to interact with smart-contract. noticed that, this doesn't mean we do not support `create2`. you can use create2 whenever you want. but if it has not been created on chain, you can not use this address as parameter to feed other contracts. the address type converting will go wrong. as soon as the contract been created, there is no limit.
- currently we are **NOT** supporting transfer ether to another EOA address directly via provider for safety reason, so if you are sending a transfer transaction through polyjuice-provider, it won't work. however, you can still construct a transaction which interact with ERC20-contract and tell the contract to transfer token for you.

## How To Develop This Project

```sh
yarn
yarn build
```

## Test

start a devnet via [Godwoken-Kicker](https://github.com/RetricSu/godwoken-kicker) on your local environment.

run

```sh
yarn env
```

to generate .env file across all workspace. the terminal will ask you to enter some polyjuice config.

default web3 rpc url is `localhost:8024`(and ws rpc is `localhost:8024/ws`), if you want to use that default value, just press enter directly. the rollup type hash and eth account lock hash are optional parameters too, you can skip those as well.

finally, you can run all tests with

```sh
yarn test
```
